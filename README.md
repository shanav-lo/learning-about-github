What I Learned About GitHub

During this course, I learned the fundamentals of version control with GitHub, including how to create repositories, manage branches, and collaborate through pull requests. Here are some key points:

Repositories: A place to store and manage your projects.
Branches: Useful for working on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
Pull Requests: A way to propose changes and discuss them with collaborators.
Areas of Confusion
Despite my progress, I still find myself confused about:

The best practices for managing merge conflicts.
How to effectively use GitHub Actions for automation.
IDE Setup
I set up Visual Studio Code for my development work, which has streamlined my coding process significantly.
